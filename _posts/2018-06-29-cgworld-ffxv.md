This month, [CGWorld](https://cgworld.jp) has provided a write-up of Image Engine's contributions to the Japanese-produced CG film Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV. Gaffer greatly aided the lighting department and daily automation during production of their 23-minute sequence for the film.

Yuta Shimizu, one of the CG Supervisors overseeing the show, commented on Gaffer's crucial role in the process:

> Technology-wise, Gaffer is the noteworthy component. It templatizes workflows, which allows artists to focus on their creative work, instead of processes. It has been the core of Image Engine's pipeline, and its integration was instrumental in taking on a project like this. We have a Gaffer-to-Shotgun query that allows templates to be dynamically applied to dailies, which lets artists focus on tweaking key shots and then applying the tweaked settings to the rest. At the end of the day, the IE lighting team was able to pump out 360 shots with an average of 6 lighters working on the project at a time. This same Gaffer templating process was used in certain departments' QC, such as CFX with their penetration checks, and FX with their destruction lookdev compatibility.
