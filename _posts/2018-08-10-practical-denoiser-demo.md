Supplementing his presentation of a novel denoising method at this year's SIGGRAPH, Daniel Dresser (Image Engine's shading specialist) will host a 5-minute talk at the Gaffer [Birds of a Feather]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-09-siggraph-2018 %}) meeting, demonstrating a free implementation of the denoiser built in Gaffer.

Just in time for the talk, Daniel has provided a download for the implementation and instructions for its use [here](https://github.com/ImageEngine/practicalDenoising).

> **Note:** This implementation requires the Arnold renderer.
