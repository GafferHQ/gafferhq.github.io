FMX 2014 - Gaffer - Exploring and rendering the exploding Droid from Elysium from [Cortex on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/cortex).

{% include vimeo.html media='https://player.vimeo.com/video/93273775' %}

We reconstructed the lookdev for the exploding Droid from Elysium inside of Gaffer. This video demonstrates navigation of a complex scene hierarchy, interactive preview rendering through 3delight, tweaking shaders and light positions live, and finally slapping the render over the original plate. The droid has approximately 2 million polygons and 150 gb of textures.
