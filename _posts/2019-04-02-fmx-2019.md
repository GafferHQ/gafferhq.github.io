Two of the fine folk involved with Gaffer development will be presenting at FMX 2019! Andrew Kaufman, R&D Lead at Image Engine and Gaffer developer, and Carsten Kolve, DFX Supervisor at Image Engine, will host two talks that cover Gaffer, OSL, and Arnold.

If you're a Gaffer or Arnold enthusiast, this is a great opportunity to discover how Image Engine wields them together in the studio. Andrew and Carsten will cover:

- Arnold's integration with Gaffer’s flexible, node based workflow
- Large scale visual effects and animation productions with Gaffer
- The internal structure of real-world hero production assets
 and lighting setups
- How Image Engine takes advantage of Gaffer's modular structure and Arnold's node system

Both presenters will be available for questions afterward.

If OSL is more your thing, Andrew will take you on a blazing-fast tour of OSL in a production pipeline. He will highlight several unique real-world uses of OSL, including:

- Procedural mesh and hair deformation
- Authoring and modifying CG environments
- Interactive image compositing
- OSL as a replacement for Python
- Sampling and generating Volumes (authoring OpenVDB grids)
- Interactive visual programming with OSL for use in any of the above scenarios

Andrew will be available for questions afterward.
