Typically, you pin a node to an editor by selecting it in the _Graph Editor_ and then clicking ![the pin button](/content/images/gaffer-ui/targetNodesUnlocked.png) in another editor. However, if you're in a hurry, there's a faster way, which we'll show you today.

![Demo of quickly pinning multiple nodes to various editors]({{ page.images }}/tip-quick-node-pinning.gif)

To quickly pin a node, middle-click and drag the node from the _Graph Editor_ onto another editor. You can even drop the dragged node onto an editor in another tab. With this shortcut, you can set up a Gaffer window layout with multiple pinned nodes in no time.
