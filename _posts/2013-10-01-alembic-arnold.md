Gaffer - Reading Alembic files and rendering through Arnold from [Cortex on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/cortex).

{% include vimeo.html media='https://player.vimeo.com/video/75892547' %}

Gaffer supports Alembic caches as input files, allowing for animated geometry and hierarchies to be read in from the wide range of applications that export to Alembic. As Gaffer has a timeline and 3d viewer it could be used as a simple Alembic cache inspection/preview tool.

Gaffer also has basic Arnold rendering support, and in this video we show renders being sent to the Gaffer display, the creation of lights and some very basic shader-network construction.
