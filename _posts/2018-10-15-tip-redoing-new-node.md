You will sometimes find yourself having to add several new nodes of the same type to the graph. You could create a node and copy-paste it, but there's an even faster way: after creating a node, just hit <kbd>Tab</kbd>, then <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and you will instantly create another new node of the same type.
