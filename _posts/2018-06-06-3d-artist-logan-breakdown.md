Image Engine's work creating digital humans was featured in February's issue of [3D Artist Magazine](https://3dartistonline.com), which shows off Gaffer's capabilities in handling photoreal character lookdev and lighting using a multitude of shaders in a studio pipeline.

Gaffer developer Andrew Kaufman had this to say about Gaffer's integration into the process: 

> For shading, we used a combination of shaders from Solid Angle, alShaders and in-house OSL shaders, all combined together in Gaffer. At the time, both the subsurface model and the caustics available with alSurface were definitely a game changer for us, both in terms of look/plausibility and performance.

Here is the full excerpt from February's issue:
