Gaffer developer Andrew Kaufman had this to say about Gaffer's integration into the process: 

> For shading, we used a combination of shaders from Solid Angle, alShaders and in-house OSL shaders, all combined together in Gaffer. At the time, both the subsurface model and the caustics available with alSurface were definitely a game changer for us, both in terms of look/plausibility and performance.
