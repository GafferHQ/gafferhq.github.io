This month, [Animation World Network](https://www.awn.com) wrote a brief on Image Engine Design's VFX work for season 1 of Netflix's Lost in Space. From rigging to final render, Gaffer played an integral part as the glue that joined all the parts of the studio's pipeline.

Joao Sita, VFX supervisor on the show, described the interplay of software in the production:

> We used Maya, 3DEqualizer for tracking, Nuke, Houdini for effects, Silhouette, and Mocha for prep. Then we have our own proprietary [customization of] Gaffer that integrates all of the software together.
